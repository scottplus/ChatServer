TODO:

- handle exceptions on Client.java input streams when server crashes/input stream fails

- allow Client.java to close properly when window is closed, see jframe.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE), maybe rewrite in JFrame? Handle key events by implementing KeyListener? Have a think on this design maybe best to leave it

- close byte streams on Client.java side when the ./quit command is used

- show available API on ./help

- add to API

- store remote IP addresses against usernames? Not sure what use this would be but yeah.

- private messages? Can use overridden broadcast messages, display in pink for private? Or startup new Client.java? This can be later on down the road

- map username to index? e.g kick 'USERNAME'
